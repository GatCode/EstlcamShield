## About
The EstlcamShield is a **free** and **open source** PCB design which provides full functionallity of the Estlcam Software. All software-supported pins are provided on the PCB via seperate headers. This shield is specifically designed to work with the [MPCNC](https://www.v1engineering.com/specifications/).

## Component List
- 1x Arduino Mega 2560
- 3x DRV8825 Stepper Driver Board
- 3x 35V 100uF Capacitor (Through Hole)
- 1x KF301-2P Terminal Block (or simmilar)
- 0-9x jumper cap for microstepping
- long female pin headers 2.54mm (I used 8 pin ones)
- regular male pin headers 2.54mm

## Getting Started
You basically have **three** different options:
- Use the included .zip folder, which contains Gerber files, to order your custom PCB from a manufacturer of your choice
- Etch or mill the PCB yourself
- Hit me up on Gitter or via eMail because I ordered a few spare PCBs which I am not using

After you have produced/bought the PCB, solder the necessary components and stack the shield onto your Arduino Mega 2560. Then connect it to your computer and flash the Arduino in the settings of the Estlcam software. You can find good videos about this process on YouTube (the process is simmilar on the Arduino Uno).

Congratulations, you are now running Estlcam in combination with your Arduino Mega! Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
